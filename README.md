Powerful engine for playing and modding idTech based games.

# What is FTEQW?

FTEQW is an advanced and portable Quake engine. It supports multiple games running on idTech, plus its own set of games that developers have created.

Due to the vast amount of supported formats, features, and innovations inside the engine and its very own QuakeC compiler (FTEQCC), it's very much considered the swiss-army knife of Quake engines.

### Highlights:

- Single & multi-player support
- Supports multiple games
- Vast amount of map, model & image formats are supported
- Advanced console, with descriptions & autocompletion
- Plugin support, enabling use of FFMPEG, Bullet/ODE physics & more
- Extensive suite of QuakeC/entity debugging features
- Deep integration with FTEQCC (fork of QuakeC created for FTEQW), which can even be executed in-game
- Support for split-screen local multiplayer
- Voice-chat via Opus & Speex
- Support for hundreds of players on a single server
- Works on Windows, Linux, OpenBSD... & more!
- New features are added all the time in cooperation with modders!
