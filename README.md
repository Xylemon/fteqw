# FTEQW

https://fteqw.org

Powerful engine for playing and modding idTech based games.

# What is FTEQW?

FTEQW is the advanced, portable Quake engine. It supports multiple games 
running on idTech, plus its own set of games that developers have created.
Due to the vast amount of supported formats, features and innovations
inside the engine and its very own QuakeC compiler (fteqcc), it's very much
considered the swiss-army knife of Quake engines.

Some highlights:

- Single & multi-player support.
- Supports multiple games (see above)
- Vast amount of map, model & image formats are supported
- Advanced console, with descriptions & autocompletion
- Plugin support, enabling use of FFMPEG, Bullet/ODE physics & more
- Extensive suite of QuakeC/entity debugging features
- Deep integration with FTEQCC (fork of QuakeC created for FTEQW), which can even be executed in-game
- Support for split-screen local multiplayer
- Voice-chat via Opus & Speex
- Support for hundreds of players on a single server
- Works on Windows, Linux, OpenBSD... & more!
- New features are added all the time in cooperation with modders!

- What version of FTEQW you're using
- What game/mod/plugin/etc you're having issues with, the version info for it, and how it should be behaving
